  # Fix Contact Inquiries RLS Policy

  1. Changes
    - Drop all existing policies on contact_inquiries table
    - Create a simple policy that allows anonymous users to insert contact inquiries
    - Ensure the policy works with the current application code

  2. Security
    - Allow anonymous and authenticated users to create contact inquiries
    - No read access needed for public users
*/

-- Drop all existing policies on contact_inquiries
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can create inquiries" ON contact_inquiries;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow contact form submissions" ON contact_inquiries;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Anyone can create and read own inquiries" ON contact_inquiries;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Public can create and read contact inquiries" ON contact_inquiries;

-- Also allow reading for the same users (needed for the .select() call after insert)
CREATE POLICY "Enable reading contact inquiries after creation"
  ON contact_inquiries
  FOR SELECT
  TO anon, authenticated
  USING (true);
